Description: Performs fast detection of interactions in large-scale
    data using the method of random intersection trees introduced in
    Shah, R. D. and Meinshausen, N. (2014)
    <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v15/shah14a.html>. 
    The algorithm finds potentially high-order interactions in
    high-dimensional binary two-class classification data, without
    requiring lower order interactions to be informative.  The search
    is particularly fast when the matrices of predictors are sparse.
    It can also be used to perform market basket analysis
    when supplied with a single binary data matrix.  Here it will find
    collections of columns which for many rows contain all 1's.
    .
    Additions by BV:  more information exposed to the user, better
    parallelization (of OPENMP is available).
